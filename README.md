# How-to-update-a-file-through-a-Python-algorithm
A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have access to this content. I created an algorithm to automate updating the "allow_list.txt" file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access. 
# Project description
At my organization, access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses. The "allow_list.txt" file identifies these IP addresses. A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have access to this content. I created an algorithm to automate updating the "allow_list.txt" file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access.
